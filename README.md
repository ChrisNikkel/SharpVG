# SharpVG

A .NET Core library for F# to generate vector graphics in SVG format.

## Why SharpVG?

 - Allows you to emit SVG using simple F# commands so that you can create graphics and animations that are easy to distribute
 - Ability to render dynamically using [Fable](http://fable.io) to create interactive web pages
 - All basic SVG elements are supported: line, circle, ellipse, rect, text, polygon, polyline, path, image, and groups
 - No understanding of SVG is required and its as easy as using seq, list, or array
 - No external dependencies other than SharpVG are required
 - .NET Core cross platform support on Windows, Linux, and OSX
 - Limited support for SVG animations
 - Limited support for cartesian plotting
 - Reusable styles
